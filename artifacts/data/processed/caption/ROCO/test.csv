artifacts\data\raw\images\ROCO\ROCO_22764.jpg; Lung rockets.The B-line includes 7 criteria. Three are constant: 1) This is a comet-tail, vertical artifact. 2) It arises from the pleural line. 3) It moves in concert with lung sliding. Four criteria are quite always present. 4) It does not fade, descends up to the edge of the screen. 5) It is well-defined, laser like. 6) It is hyperechoic, like the pleural line. 7) It obliterates the A-lines. All these criteria make it always possible to recognize B-lines from other comet-tail artifacts (E-lines, Z-lines...).The B-line can be isolated, with little meaning. Multiple B-lines, like in this view (three being visible), are then called “lung rockets”, and indicate interstitial syndrome - usually interstitial edema when seen in acute settings.

(A) Multiple necrotic portocaval lymph nodes are shown here. Mild narrowing of the proximal superior vena cava by the necrotic mass is seen within the mediastinum. A necrotic enhancing soft-tissue mass occupies the majority of the mediastinum above the heart. This mass represents a confluence of necrotic lymphadenopathy. It is compressing the superior vena cava proximally, but the vessel remains patent. The conglomerate soft-tissue mass in the mediastinum is also pushing the pulmonary artery and aorta to the left, causing elongation and narrowing of the right pulmonary artery, and is partially compressing the right bronchus as well. (B) This chest CT demonstrates numerous hypodense nodules in the liver and in the spleen that represent foci of coccidioidomycosis infection. The abnormal enhancement of the liver is likely related to SVC compression. (C) Multiple cystic structures demonstrated within the spleen.

An asymmetrically enhancing mass lesion is seen in the sella turcia with extension to bilateral internal carotid artery. Patient 2's serum prolactin level was 183.7 ng/ml. The patient was treated with MASEP GKRS twice because of the huge volume of the mass. The second MASEP GKRS was performed 1 year after the first one. The tumor was treated separately with the lower and upper part in order to protect the optic chiasma. MRI was performed for treatment planning. 25 Gy defined to the 50% isodose line is used to cover the lower part of the pituitary tumor in the first treatment, and 18 Gy defined to the 50% isodose line is used to cover the upper part of the pituitary tumor in the second time.
